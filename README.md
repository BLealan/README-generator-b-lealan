# Node.js README Generator

## Description

This application was created to dynamically create a README.md file, populated by users' input in their command line using node.js. This allows developers time to focus more on coding!  
After typing `node index.js` into their command line, the user is presented with a series of prompts, dictated by an array of question objects. The responses are used in the `generateMarkdown` function using 'object destructuring' in 'template literals' for a basic README skeleton. Most types are that of `input`, but the question of 'license' brings a series of licenses (source for popular license choices in 'Sources'); the function `renderLicense` runs a `switch statement` to compare the returned `string`, and generates a badge and link accordingly (link for pre-made badges in Sources). The file is then written!  
This was a great introduction to node and the concept of modularization, splitting up the process into separate files and bringing them together in one main `index.js`. It also was good practice for longer README styling, and some extra spaces and indentation went a long way to disrupt my 'Table of Contents'!
